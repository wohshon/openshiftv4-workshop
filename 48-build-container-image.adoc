== Build Container Images

In this exercise we will learn how to create a container image based on Red Hat's
Universal Base Image (UBI) for a PHP application.

The default Dockerfile uses the standard UBI image for RHEL 7 and PHP with Apache
HTTPd from the Software Collections Library (SCL).

There are also Dockerfile variants using UBI for RHEL 8 and the minimal UBI
container images. The RHEL 8 variants take PHP and Apache HTTPd from AppStreams
because there are no more SCLs for RHEL 8.

For more information about UBI, see:

- https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers/index?lb_target=stage#using_red_hat_universal_base_images_standard_minimal_and_runtimes

=== Logging in

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username. It should be all lowercase and no spaces.

- Console URL: {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Accept the warning for self sign certificates (if prompted)

image::login-providers.png[image]

- You will be asked to choose a authentication provider
- Click `workshop_htpasswd_provider`

image::ocp4-login.png[image]

- Proceed to login with the username and password that were provided to you and you should hit the OpenShift console home page

=== Create a project
- After logging in, 
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *buildimage-<Username>* e.g. *buildImage-user01* as `Name` of the project. The display name and description is optional.

image::ocp4-build-create-project.png[image]

- Click `Create`

- Alternatively, you can run this command below via CLI.
....
$ oc new-project buildimage-Username
....

=== Create an application that uses Dockerfile

You can build your container image locally via podman or docker CLI with
similar steps as shown below.

NOTE: Below steps are NOT for this lab. It is just an example how you would build
an image locally.

....
$ git clone https://github.com/wohshon/testphp-ubi.git
$ cd testphp
$ sudo podman login -u <your service account name> -p <your service account token>
$ sudo podman build -t php-ubi .
$ sudo podman run --name hello -p 8080:8080 -d localhost/php-ubi
$ curl localhost:8080
<html>
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
</html>
$ sudo podman stop hello
$ sudo podman rm hello
....

==== Build container Image on Openshift

With OpenShift, we will be building the container image, deploy the container as
an application, and ready to be consume.



- Create an application via the Dockerfile
- Make sure you are in the right project
....
[~] $ oc project buildimage-user01
Now using project "buildimage-user01" on server "https://api.cluster-dbs-ad12.dbs-ad12.example.opentlc.com:6443".
....

- We will use the `oc new-app` command to deploy an application based on a Dockerfile.
- Based on the url provided, the command looks up to github repository where a Dockerfile is hosted; an image based on the Dockerfile instructions will be built and pushed into the integrated image registry on OpenShift. 

- To begin deployment, run the following command.
....
[~] $ oc new-app --name hello https://github.com/wohshon/testphp-ubi.git
....

- You will see output similar to the following
....
--> Found Docker image 22ba711 (3 weeks old) from registry.access.redhat.com for "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi"
    Red Hat Universal Base Image 7
    ------------------------------
    The Universal Base Image is designed and engineered to be the base layer fo
r all of your containerized applications, middleware and utilities. This base i
mage is freely redistributable, but Red Hat only supports Red Hat technologies
through subscriptions for Red Hat products. This image is maintained by Red Hat
 and updated regularly.

    Tags: base rhel7

    * An image stream tag will be created as "ubi:latest" that will track the s
ource image
    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/piggyvenus/testp
hp-ubi.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "hello:latest"
      * Every time "ubi:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "hello"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "hello"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "hello"
    * WARNING: Image "registry.redhat.io/ubi7/ubi" runs as the 'root' user whic
h may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
....

- Wait for the build to finish
- You can run the following `oc logs -f bc/hello` command to see the output of the build process. (bc is the build configuration object of this app we are deploying)

- Wait for the application pod to be ready and Running
- Run `oc get pods` to check the status

- Create a route for the application's service
- This creates an external facing url , `oc expose svc hello`
....
[~] $ oc expose svc hello

....

- Test the application using the route
- Use `oc get route` to get the url, and either test the url in a browser or using the `cURL` command.
....

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learnt how to create, build
and deploy an application using OpenShift's "Build Container strategy".
