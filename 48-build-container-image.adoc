== Build Container Images

OpenShift Container Platform supports many ways for users to deploy their applications, via source codes, binaries, Container images etc.

In this exercise we will learn how to create and deploy a container image based on Red Hat's Universal Base Image (UBI) for a PHP application. 
The container image is built by passing Dockerfile https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/[What is a Docker file] to OpenShift Container Platform.


=== Logging in

IMPORTANT: Please replace *Username* with your username. It should be all lowercase and no spaces.

- Console URL: {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
- Accept the warning for self sign certificates (if prompted)

image::login-providers.png[image]

- You will be asked to choose a authentication provider
- Click `workshop_htpasswd_provider`

image::ocp4-login.png[image]

- Proceed to login with the username and password that were provided to you and you should hit the OpenShift console home page

=== Create a project
- After logging in, 
- On the left-hand side menu, select `Home` and then select `Project`
- Click `Create Project`
- Enter *buildimage-<Username>* e.g. *buildImage-user01* as `Name` of the project. The display name and description is optional.

image::ocp4-build-create-project.png[image]

- Click `Create`

- Alternatively, you can run this command below via CLI.
....
$ oc new-project buildimage-Username
....

=== Create an application that uses Dockerfile

You can build your container image locally via podman or docker CLI with
similar steps as shown below.

NOTE: Below steps are NOT for this lab. It is just an example how you would build
an image locally.

....
$ git clone https://github.com/wohshon/testphp-ubi.git
$ cd testphp
$ sudo podman login -u <your service account name> -p <your service account token>
$ sudo podman build -t php-ubi .
$ sudo podman run --name hello -p 8080:8080 -d localhost/php-ubi
$ curl localhost:8080
<html>
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
</html>
$ sudo podman stop hello
$ sudo podman rm hello
....

==== Build container Image on Openshift

With OpenShift, we will be building the container image and deploying the container as
an application by referencing a Dockerfile.

NOTE: To simplify the lab, we are using a image repository that is due to be decommissioned. Going forward, you should register a Red Hat Developer Account at  https://developers.redhat.com. This will allow you to obtain tokens (https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/) to authenticate to the latest image registry.

- Let's get started to create an application via the Dockerfile
- Make sure you are in the right project
....
[~] $ oc project buildimage-user01
Now using project "buildimage-user01" on server "https://api.cluster-dbs-ad12.dbs-ad12.example.opentlc.com:6443".
....

- We will use the `oc new-app` command to deploy an application based on a Dockerfile.
- Based on the url provided, the command looks up to github repository where a Dockerfile is hosted; an image based on the Dockerfile instructions will be built and pushed into the integrated image registry on OpenShift. 

- Feel free to examine the Dockerfile at the github repo to understand how the image is built.

- To begin deployment, run the following command.
....
[~] $ oc new-app --name hello https://github.com/wohshon/testphp-ubi.git
....

- You will see output similar to the following
....
--> Found Docker image 22ba711 (3 weeks old) from registry.access.redhat.com for "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi7/ubi"
    Red Hat Universal Base Image 7
    ------------------------------
    The Universal Base Image is designed and engineered to be the base layer fo
r all of your containerized applications, middleware and utilities. This base i
mage is freely redistributable, but Red Hat only supports Red Hat technologies
through subscriptions for Red Hat products. This image is maintained by Red Hat
 and updated regularly.

    Tags: base rhel7

    * An image stream tag will be created as "ubi:latest" that will track the s
ource image
    * A Docker build using source code from https://github.com/piggyvenus/testp
hp-ubi.git will be created
      * The resulting image will be pushed to image stream tag "hello:latest"
      * Every time "ubi:latest" changes a new build will be triggered
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "hello"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "hello"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "hello"
    * WARNING: Image "registry.redhat.io/ubi7/ubi" runs as the 'root' user whic
h may not be permitted by your cluster administrator

    Run 'oc status' to view your app.

- Wait for the build to finish
- You can run the following `oc logs -f bc/hello` command to see the output of the build process. (bc is the build configuration object of this app we are deploying)

- Wait for the application pod to be ready and Running
- Run `oc get pods` to check the status
....

- Create a route for the application's service
- This creates an external facing url , `oc expose svc hello`
....
[~] $ oc expose svc hello

- Test the application using the route
- Use `oc get route` to get the url, and either test the url in a browser or using the `cURL` command.
....

Congratulations!! In this exercise you have learnt how to create, build
and deploy an application using OpenShift's "Build Container strategy".
